# Dotfiles

This is all my dotfiles.
The purpose of this repository is to keep in sync all configuration files for my OS.
Current idea is to have three branches: Arch, Debian and MacOS.
- find out how to create branches
- add pandoc syntax to markdown, check speed startup

All these files are in sync with GNU stow.

GNU stow is an utility that manages symlinks, such that I can have all my files in one directory, organized by application.
Each folder contain the path for the various configuration files and are named to reflect the application that they are going to configure.
My ideal is to keep divided all settings for each application, such that loading a folder does not require other files.
This will be useful later if I want to use different Windows Managers, or for creating scripts for auto-ricing.

## Folders
